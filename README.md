The task is to build a website using React. This will be based on the Punk API.

This was my first solo react project.

Plans:
- to add the API and get it functioning correctly
- get the check boxes working correctly with the search filters
- to fix the pop out page of info that I broke fixing another problem I had.
- improve styling and design layout
